### PYNCHMARK - a benchmark tool for benchmarking processes
> Written in Python and works in almost all platform

This tool is made for an assignment purpose and does not have many functionality.

But you can use it as a simple tool to evaluate or compare two processes running on the bare metal.
The project may or may not be maintained depending on the response I get from it.
